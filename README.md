# text-analysis
CS173 Project 1 <br/>
## The Idea <br/>
The idea is to process a body of text, looking for and recording word appearances in the text. We will build a listing of all the words that appear in a body of text. Additionally, we also keep track of where 
these words appear by maintaining a list of all sentences containing the words. Keep in mind that we also need to be able to search the text for locations of various words.   
<br/>

## Output <br/>
The program produces a listing of all words (in lowercase) appearing in the text file, 
sorted alphabetically. It also prompts the user to enter one of the words.  The program will 
then output that word again, along with a listing of each sentence where that word appears.  
Each sentence is preceded with the sentence number.
<br/>
